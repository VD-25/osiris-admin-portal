- Project Plan: https://github.com/VD-25/osiris-admin-portal/blob/main/ProjectPlan.md 
Steps for each API: API's to be written in node.js
with starting base repo:
team member needs to clone repo and and npm init a node.js project
set up index.js with an express server (similar to microservice API exercise) etc and commit/push it back to repo
everyone then clones the now node.js init'd repo to their machines and creates can code their API's (1 file per API preferably)

Additionally, we have created a ruleset stating that each pull request needs to be reviewed by at least one member before it can be merged. We have also created a Task, Bug, and Documentation template issue for future reference.
